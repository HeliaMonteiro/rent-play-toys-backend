# Rent & Play Toys

This is my General Assembly final project, I've built a page to rent toys. 
Rent and Play Toys is an idea inspired by my loved nephew Vinicius who is overseas because sometimes I would love to give him all the cool toys he deserves.

But sometimes it isn't possible because some toys are very expensive and I, his mom, and you for sure know that usually, kids lose their interest in one specific toy really fast and just move on to another toy. 

So the main idea of my page is to make some toys more accessible for those who want to make the little ones happy, playing with a cool toy even for a short period of time.

Rent & Play Toy has a variety of toys that usually are more expensive, most offer more than one use option providing more fun.

## :bookmark_tabs: About

The main idea of this page is to make some toys more accessible.

Rent and Play Toys provides a lot of toy categories, such as educational, activities, and outside.

On the main page the user sees all toys available and unavailable, by clicking on the toy it will show toy details: product description, category, recommended age to play, and items included.

To rent a toy users have to log in or sign up, and after selecting any toy it will show days of rent options, after clicking on the rent button the toy becomes unavailable, and users can see their rent history and return a rented toy. 
This is a full stack project, I'm using Strapi for back-end content management and React and Javascript for my front end.

 * Search input is not working. 
 * Header and Footer links are not working. 
 * Some elements aren't responsive.

## :mending_heart: Lessons learnt

 Organizing this page idea to define MVP was hard. 
 Keep things simple and do them step-by-step. 

## :star_struck: Future features

 Make search input and all links work, create a payment form, and make it totally responsive.
